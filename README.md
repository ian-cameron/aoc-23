 # Advent of Code 2023
 [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) describes itself as:

>&ldquo;...an Advent calendar of small programming  
puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be  
solved in any programming language you like. People use them as  
interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice  
problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.&rdquo;

I'm trying it out this year.  Its new to me.  The way it works is each challenge will reward one star, and there is a part 2 (a twist) for each challenge that awards a second star. 

 I plan to use a few new languages or approaches to get the most of it. Each of the 25 days will be in a subdirectory of this repo.

**UPDATE week 1:**
I've made 8 solutions with 8 different languages so far, but these are getting harder to do.  Not sure if I will be able to continue using unique lanauges for 16 more days, as the puzzles are getting trickier.  Some have taken a long time and I'm staying up late.  I may have to use someting more familar a couple of times to save time.

**UPDATE week 2:**
Its day 12 and things have gotten a lot more difficult.  These are now hard enough that I will need to use some more familar languages to have a chance of finishing this challenge.  Maybe if a few softballs come up I can mix in some new languages but the solutions (and Part 2 solutions) are difficult enough.  The offical [statistics](https://adventofcode.com/2023/stats) show that I'm not alone.  While almost 207,000 people completed Day 1, only about 17,500 completed Day 12.

### Standard Solution Layout
* Each day is in a folder, and has a README with Parts 1 and 2 of that day's question, and the output of the program (the solutions)
* Each program is a single source file named `solution`
* Each program assumes there is a file named `input` in the same directory as the source code.
* Will utilize the standard library if possible, no external modules or dependencies.

* Outputs will be written to the console, eg)
  ```
  Part 1: <answer>
  Part 2: <answer>
  ```
* Compiled / Interpreted on Windows PC
