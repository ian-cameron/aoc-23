 # Advent of Code 2023
 https://adventofcode.com/2023/ describes it as:

 &ldquo;Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.&rdquo;

I'm trying it out this year.  Its new to me, but seems like each challenge will reward one star, and there is a part 2 for every challenge that awards a second star. 

 I plan to use a few new languages or approaches to get the most of it. Each of the 25 days will be in a subdirectory of this repo.

I'm copying the text of each challenge into the README of each folder.  I'll inlclude notes on how to run each solution as necessary.
