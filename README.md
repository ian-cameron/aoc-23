 # Advent of Code 2023
 https://adventofcode.com/2023/ describes it as:

>&ldquo;Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming  
puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be  
solved in any programming language you like. People use them as  
interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice  
problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.&rdquo;

I'm trying it out this year.  Its new to me, but seems like each challenge will reward one star, and there is a part 2 for every challenge that awards a second star. 

 I plan to use a few new languages or approaches to get the most of it. Each of the 25 days will be in a subdirectory of this repo.

**UPDATE week 1:**
I've made 8 solutions with 8 different languages, but these are getting harder to do.  Not sure if I will be able to continue using unique lanauges for 16 more days, as the puzzles are getting trickier.  Some have taken a long time and I'm staying up late.  I may have to use someting more familar a couple of times to save time.

### Standard Solution Layout
* Each day is in a folder, and has a README with Parts 1 and 2 of that day's question, and the output of the program (the solutions)
* Each program is a single source file named `solution`
* Each program assumes there is a file named `input` in the same directory as the source code.
* Will utilize the standard library if possible, no external modules or dependencies.

* Outputs will be written to the console, eg)
  ```
  Part 1: <answer>
  Part 2: <answer>
  ```
* Compiled / Interpreted on Windows PC
